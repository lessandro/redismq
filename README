Yet another redis message queue convenience library. This one is in C and uses
libev.

Goals:

- libev
- blpop/rpush message queue
- never loses messages
- all messages sent in order
- automatically and transparently reconnects in case of disconnection
- C98, switch to C++11 possible though
- MIT license
- pet throwaway project, don't take it seriously.
